# Header Careers

The "Remote works! Join us." banner in the `Header`.

## Import

```tsx
import { HeaderCareers } from "@imgly-labs/imgly-website-components";
```

## Usage

This component is positioned absolutely and has different states for resolutions greater than `lg`, between `lg` and `sm`, and below `sm`.

> By default `HeaderWrapper` will be the relative anchor element which will need a top margin of `2rem` for the `sm` breakpoint.

```tsx
<HeaderWrapper>
  <HeaderCareers />
</HeaderWrapper>
```
