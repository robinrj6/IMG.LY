# Cookies

The Cookies component is used across all IMG.LY websites.

<Story of={CookiesStories.Default} />

## Import

```tsx
import { Cookies } from "@imgly-labs/imgly-website-components";
```

or

```html
<div id="imgly-website-components-cookies"></div>
```

## Usage

This component can be used standalone or as a parent that exposes the `CookieContext` to its children.

The `CookieContext` will provide information on which cookie types are currently allowed if you need this information for a specific widget or package.

_index.tsx_

```tsx
import { Cookies } from "@imgly-labs/imgly-website-components";

import { App } from "./App";

const Index = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Cookies>
      <App />
    </Cookies>
  );
};
```

_App.tsx_

```tsx
import { useContext } from "react";

import { CookieContext } from "@imgly-labs/imgly-website-components";

const App = () => {
  const { trackFunctionality, trackAdvertisement, trackAnalytics } =
    useContext(CookieContext);

  return <div>App</div>;
};
```
